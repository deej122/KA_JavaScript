Built using Angular.js and Node.js written in CoffeeScript with a MongoDB database (not used, but capable of being used if project is expanded upon), and HTML/CSS. Dependencies setup using NPM and Bower.
     
Used Acorn to parse the JavaScript mainly because of the superior documentation and the ease of setup with Node.
          
Used CodeMirror in place of a standard HTML textarea for aesthetic appeal and built in JavaScript formatting capabilities.
